This is the folder for running iqtree
I downloaded and installed the app in this folder from ```http://www.iqtree.org/#download```
I followed steps from http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Quickstart#for-windows-users
I ran into problems with this code: ```bin\iqtree -s example.phy```
Simply change it into ```bin/iqtree -s example.phy``` works.

I pasted my fasta file into both bin folder and iqtree folder, then used this code
```bin/iqtree -s fraserav1-aligned.fasta```
Output:
Analysis results written to:
  IQ-TREE report:                fraserav1-aligned.fasta.iqtree
  Maximum-likelihood tree:       fraserav1-aligned.fasta.treefile
  Likelihood distances:          fraserav1-aligned.fasta.mldist
  Screen log file:               fraserav1-aligned.fasta.log
